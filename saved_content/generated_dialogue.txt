**Bruce Wayne**: (Sighs, running a hand through his hair) He's different, Harvey. This isn't about money, or power. It's... anarchy.

**Harvey Dent**: Anarchy can be dealt with. We're making progress, Bruce. We’re taking back the streets, one indictment at a time. We'll get him.

**Bruce Wayne**: You think so? He anticipates our every move. He doesn't care about anything. That's what makes him so dangerous.

**Harvey Dent**: Everyone cares about something, Bruce. Even madmen have a breaking point. We just need to find it. Rachel believes in me. In us. In what we're building here.

**Bruce Wayne**: Rachel also cares about Gotham. That's why she supports what you're doing, Harvey. But this… this feels different. He's testing me. Pushing me.

**Joker**: (A chilling voice crackles over a nearby radio, interrupting them) Testing, testing… is this thing on? Hello, boys! Having a little chat about me, are we?

**Harvey Dent**: (Furious) We're coming for you, clown. Your little game ends now.

**Joker**: (Laughing maniacally over the radio) Oh, Harvey, Harvey. You still believe in rules? I'm offering Gotham a choice! A little… social experiment. See, all it takes is a little pressure… and suddenly, even you, Harvey Dent… would look the fool.

**Bruce Wayne**: (Into the radio, his voice a low growl) I won't let you hurt anyone else.

**Joker**: You think you can stop me? You're playing by their rules, Batsy. And their rules are rigged! Tell you what, to make it interesting, I'll give you a choice. Which one of your pretty little lives are you willing to sacrifice? The crusader, or the white knight? Tick-tock, time is running out.

**Harvey Dent**: (Turns to Bruce, his face pale) What does he mean? What choice?

**Bruce Wayne**: (His jaw tightens) He's playing us, Harvey. Trying to break us. Don't let him. We stick to the plan. We keep fighting.

**Harvey Dent**: What plan? He has Rachel. Bruce, what aren't you telling me?

**Bruce Wayne**: (Looks away, guilt etched on his face) I... I have to go.
